# General Coding Guidelines

Core principles

- Modular design: Prefer module-level functions; pass explicit context.
- Type safety: Use types consistently; enable strict modes where available.
- Clear structure: Split logic into small, focused files/functions.

Best practices

- Readability: Prefer clarity over cleverness; name things well.
- Errors: Handle and propagate explicitly; never swallow silently.
- Tests: Add/maintain tests to prevent regressions.
